### Task 0: Setup

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Time**: 2025-10-20

**Goal**: Create implementation log file

**Changes Made**:
- Created `docs/logs/2025-10-20-event-audit-trail-implementation.md`
- Ready to begin implementation

---

### Task 1: Add FilterResult Type

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Time**: 2025-10-20

**Goal**: Add FilterResult struct and integrate into CulturalEvent and CityEvent

**Changes Made**:
1. Created `internal/event/types.go`:
   - Added FilterResult struct with location, time, and decision tracking
   - Fields for distrito matching, GPS distance, text matching, time filtering
   - Final decision fields: Kept (bool) and FilterReason (string)
   - JSON tags for serialization

2. Updated `internal/event/event.go`:
   - Added FilterResult field to CulturalEvent struct

3. Updated `internal/event/city.go`:
   - Added FilterResult field to CityEvent struct

**Verification**:
- ✅ Build successful: `go build ./...`
- ✅ All tests pass: `go test ./...` (9 packages)

**Result**: FilterResult type ready for use in filtering pipeline

---

### Task 2: Create Audit Export Module

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Time**: 2025-10-20

**Goal**: Create internal/audit package with SaveAuditJSON function

**Changes Made**:
1. Created `internal/audit/export.go`:
   - AuditFile struct: top-level audit file structure
   - AuditPipeline struct: per-pipeline stats and events
   - SaveAuditJSON function: exports complete audit trail to JSON
   - processCulturalEvents/processCityEvents: calculate stats and breakdown
   - Atomic writes: temp file + rename for safety

2. Created `internal/audit/export_test.go`:
   - TestSaveAuditJSON: end-to-end file creation and parsing
   - TestProcessCulturalEvents: filter breakdown calculation
   - TestProcessCityEvents: city events processing
   - 3 tests covering all functionality

**Verification**:
- ✅ Build successful: `go build ./...`
- ✅ Audit tests pass: `go test ./internal/audit/...` (3 tests)
- ✅ All tests pass: `go test ./...` (10 packages)

**Result**: Audit export module ready to integrate into build pipeline

---

### Task 3: Refactor Cultural Events Filtering

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Time**: 2025-10-20

**Goal**: Change cultural events filtering from destructive (remove events) to non-destructive (tag events)

**Changes Made**:
1. Updated `cmd/buildsite/main.go` (lines 217-323):
   - **Step 1**: Evaluate ALL filters for ALL events
     - Evaluate distrito filter (hasDistrito, distritoMatched)
     - Evaluate GPS filter (hasCoordinates, gpsDistanceKm, withinRadius)
     - Evaluate text matching filter
     - Evaluate time filter (daysOld, tooOld)
     - Record final decision (kept, filterReason)
   - **Step 2**: Separate kept events for rendering
   - Removed all `continue` statements (no early exits)
   - Record FilterResult for each event
   - Keep all events in `allEvents` slice

2. Preserved existing behavior:
   - Same filter logic (distrito → GPS → text → time)
   - Same stats counting for logging
   - Same final output (219 cultural events)

**Key Improvements**:
- Non-destructive: All events kept in memory
- Complete audit trail: Every event has FilterResult
- No data loss: Can see why each event was filtered
- Same performance: Single pass through events

**Verification**:
- ✅ Build successful: `go build ./cmd/buildsite`
- ✅ All tests pass: `go test ./...` (10 packages)

**Result**: Cultural events filtering now tags instead of removes, ready for audit export

---

### Task 4: Refactor City Events Filtering

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Time**: 2025-10-20

**Goal**: Change city events filtering from destructive to non-destructive (tag events)

**Changes Made**:
1. Updated `cmd/buildsite/main.go` (lines 438-496):
   - Replaced `filter.FilterCityEvents()` call with inline filtering
   - **Step 1**: Evaluate all filters for all city events
     - GPS filter (hasCoordinates, gpsDistanceKm, withinRadius)
     - Time filter (startDate, endDate, daysOld, tooOld)
     - Record decision (kept, filterReason)
   - **Step 2**: Separate kept events for rendering
   - Removed external filter function dependency
   - Record FilterResult for each event
   - Keep all events in `allCityEvents` slice

2. Preserved existing behavior:
   - Same filter logic (GPS → time)
   - No category filtering (as before)
   - Same stats counting for logging
   - Same final output (19 city events)

**Key Improvements**:
- Non-destructive: All city events kept in memory
- Complete audit trail: Every event has FilterResult
- No data loss: Can see why each event was filtered
- Consistent with cultural events approach

**Verification**:
- ✅ Build successful: `go build ./cmd/buildsite`
- ✅ All tests pass: `go test ./...` (10 packages)

**Result**: City events filtering now tags instead of removes, ready for audit export

---

### Task 5: Integrate Audit Export

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Time**: 2025-10-20

**Goal**: Call audit.SaveAuditJSON to export complete audit trail after filtering

**Changes Made**:
1. Updated `cmd/buildsite/main.go`:
   - Added audit package import (line 12)
   - Added audit export section after both pipelines complete (lines 540-555)
   - Calls `audit.SaveAuditJSON(allEvents, allCityEvents, ...)`
   - Exports to `data/audit-events.json`
   - Logs file size and total event count
   - Graceful error handling (warning if export fails)

2. Export details:
   - Location: `{dataDir}/audit-events.json`
   - Includes: All cultural events + all city events
   - Contains: Complete event data + FilterResult for each
   - Timing: Build start time and total duration

**Integration point**:
- Placed between pipeline completion and rendering
- After: Both filtering pipelines done
- Before: HTML/JSON rendering starts
- Perfect spot: All data available, no rendering conflicts

**Verification**:
- ✅ Build successful: `go build ./cmd/buildsite`
- ✅ All tests pass: `go test ./...` (10 packages)

**Result**: Audit export fully integrated into build pipeline

---

### Task 6: Add .gitignore for Audit File

**Status**: ✅ Complete (No changes needed)
**Time**: 2025-10-20

**Goal**: Ensure audit-events.json is not committed to repository

**Finding**:
- `.gitignore` already contains `data/` (line 52)
- This covers `data/audit-events.json` automatically
- No changes needed

**Verification**:
- ✅ Checked `.gitignore` file
- ✅ Confirmed `data/` pattern exists

**Result**: Audit file already excluded from git tracking

---

### Task 7: Testing & Validation

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Time**: 2025-10-20

**Goal**: Run full build and verify audit trail system works correctly

**Testing Performed**:

1. **Initial Build Test**:
   - Ran `./build/buildsite -config config.toml`
   - Generated audit file: `data/audit-events.json` (1.5 MB)
   - Initial count: 2158 total events (1001 cultural + 1157 city)
   - ✅ File created successfully

2. **Bug Discovery - City Events Not Saved**:
   - Found city events were null in JSON
   - Root cause: AuditPipeline type mismatch (CulturalEvent vs CityEvent)
   - Fixed by using `json.RawMessage` for Events field

3. **Fix Applied**:
   - Updated `AuditPipeline.Events` to `[]json.RawMessage`
   - Updated `processCulturalEvents()` to marshal events to JSON
   - Updated `processCityEvents()` to marshal events to JSON
   - Updated test functions to handle error returns
   - ✅ All tests pass

4. **Validation Build**:
   - Ran full build with fixed code
   - Generated audit file: 4.6 MB (larger due to complete data)
   - Structure verification:
     - ✅ Top-level stats correct (total, kept, filtered, breakdown)
     - ✅ Cultural events: Full FilterResult with all fields
     - ✅ City events: Full FilterResult with all fields
   - Sample event checks:
     - ✅ Filtered event: Complete FilterResult with filter_reason
     - ✅ Kept event: Complete FilterResult with "kept" reason
     - ✅ All filter fields populated (distrito, GPS, text, time)

5. **Edge Case Test - Source Failures**:
   - Tested with cultural event sources down (network issue)
   - Result: 0 cultural events, 1157 city events
   - ✅ System handles gracefully, audits available events
   - ✅ Empty pipeline properly represented (0 total, empty breakdown)

**Success Criteria Verified**:
- ✅ All events (kept + filtered) saved to audit JSON
- ✅ Filter results recorded for every event
- ✅ Complete event data included (all fields)
- ✅ File size reasonable (4.6 MB for 1157 events)
- ✅ Can debug any filtering decision
- ✅ No performance regression (build time < 5s)
- ✅ Same rendering output as before
- ✅ All tests pass (10 packages)

**Result**: Audit trail system fully functional and validated

  "build_duration_seconds": 1.8,
  "total_events": 2158,
  "cultural_events": {
    "total": 1001,
    "kept": 219,
    "filtered": 782,
    "filter_breakdown": {
      "kept": 219,
      "outside target distrito": 750,
      "event too old": 32
    },
    "events": [ /* Full event data + FilterResult */ ]
  },
  "city_events": {
    "total": 1157,
    "kept": 19,
    "filtered": 1138,
    "filter_breakdown": {
      "kept": 19,
      "outside GPS radius": 1138
    },
    "events": [ /* Full event data + FilterResult */ ]
  }
}
```

**FilterResult Fields**:
- Location: has_distrito, distrito_matched, distrito
- GPS: has_coordinates, gps_distance_km, within_radius
- Text: text_matched
- Time: start_date, end_date, days_old, too_old
- Decision: kept, filter_reason

### Impact

**Debugging**: Can now trace any filtering decision for any event
**Transparency**: Complete visibility into what happened to every event
**Analysis**: Filter breakdown shows which filters are most active
**Data Quality**: Can identify events with missing/incomplete data
**Future Work**: Foundation for advanced analytics and filter tuning
