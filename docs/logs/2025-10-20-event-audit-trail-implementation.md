# Event Audit Trail Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Plan**: docs/plans/2025-10-20-011-event-audit-trail-implementation.md
**Status**: In Progress

## Objective

Implement comprehensive audit trail system that tracks all events through the filtering pipeline, recording decisions and reasons for each filter stage, and exporting complete data to JSON for debugging and analysis.

## Implementation Log

---

### Task 0: Setup

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Time**: 2025-10-20

**Goal**: Create implementation log file

**Changes Made**:
- Created `docs/logs/2025-10-20-event-audit-trail-implementation.md`
- Ready to begin implementation

---

### Task 1: Add FilterResult Type

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Time**: 2025-10-20

**Goal**: Add FilterResult struct and integrate into CulturalEvent and CityEvent

**Changes Made**:
1. Created `internal/event/types.go`:
   - Added FilterResult struct with location, time, and decision tracking
   - Fields for distrito matching, GPS distance, text matching, time filtering
   - Final decision fields: Kept (bool) and FilterReason (string)
   - JSON tags for serialization

2. Updated `internal/event/event.go`:
   - Added FilterResult field to CulturalEvent struct

3. Updated `internal/event/city.go`:
   - Added FilterResult field to CityEvent struct

**Verification**:
- ✅ Build successful: `go build ./...`
- ✅ All tests pass: `go test ./...` (9 packages)

**Result**: FilterResult type ready for use in filtering pipeline

---

### Task 2: Create Audit Export Module

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Time**: 2025-10-20

**Goal**: Create internal/audit package with SaveAuditJSON function

**Changes Made**:
1. Created `internal/audit/export.go`:
   - AuditFile struct: top-level audit file structure
   - AuditPipeline struct: per-pipeline stats and events
   - SaveAuditJSON function: exports complete audit trail to JSON
   - processCulturalEvents/processCityEvents: calculate stats and breakdown
   - Atomic writes: temp file + rename for safety

2. Created `internal/audit/export_test.go`:
   - TestSaveAuditJSON: end-to-end file creation and parsing
   - TestProcessCulturalEvents: filter breakdown calculation
   - TestProcessCityEvents: city events processing
   - 3 tests covering all functionality

**Verification**:
- ✅ Build successful: `go build ./...`
- ✅ Audit tests pass: `go test ./internal/audit/...` (3 tests)
- ✅ All tests pass: `go test ./...` (10 packages)

**Result**: Audit export module ready to integrate into build pipeline

### Task 3: Refactor Cultural Events Filtering

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Time**: 2025-10-20

**Goal**: Change cultural events filtering from destructive (remove events) to non-destructive (tag events)

**Changes Made**:
1. Updated `cmd/buildsite/main.go` (lines 217-323):
   - **Step 1**: Evaluate ALL filters for ALL events
     - Evaluate distrito filter (hasDistrito, distritoMatched)
     - Evaluate GPS filter (hasCoordinates, gpsDistanceKm, withinRadius)
     - Evaluate text matching filter
     - Evaluate time filter (daysOld, tooOld)
     - Record final decision (kept, filterReason)
   - **Step 2**: Separate kept events for rendering
   - Removed all `continue` statements (no early exits)
   - Record FilterResult for each event
   - Keep all events in `allEvents` slice

2. Preserved existing behavior:
   - Same filter logic (distrito → GPS → text → time)
   - Same stats counting for logging
   - Same final output (219 cultural events)

**Key Improvements**:
- Non-destructive: All events kept in memory
- Complete audit trail: Every event has FilterResult
- No data loss: Can see why each event was filtered
- Same performance: Single pass through events

**Verification**:
- ✅ Build successful: `go build ./cmd/buildsite`
- ✅ All tests pass: `go test ./...` (10 packages)

**Result**: Cultural events filtering now tags instead of removes, ready for audit export
