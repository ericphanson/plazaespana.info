# Event Audit Trail Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Plan**: docs/plans/2025-10-20-011-event-audit-trail-implementation.md
**Status**: In Progress

## Objective

Implement comprehensive audit trail system that tracks all events through the filtering pipeline, recording decisions and reasons for each filter stage, and exporting complete data to JSON for debugging and analysis.

## Implementation Log

### Task 0: Setup

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Time**: 2025-10-20

**Goal**: Create implementation log file

**Changes Made**:
- Created `docs/logs/2025-10-20-event-audit-trail-implementation.md`
- Ready to begin implementation

---

### Task 1: Add FilterResult Type

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Time**: 2025-10-20

**Goal**: Add FilterResult struct and integrate into CulturalEvent and CityEvent

**Changes Made**:
1. Created `internal/event/types.go`:
   - Added FilterResult struct with location, time, and decision tracking
   - Fields for distrito matching, GPS distance, text matching, time filtering
   - Final decision fields: Kept (bool) and FilterReason (string)
   - JSON tags for serialization

2. Updated `internal/event/event.go`:
   - Added FilterResult field to CulturalEvent struct

3. Updated `internal/event/city.go`:
   - Added FilterResult field to CityEvent struct

**Verification**:
- ✅ Build successful: `go build ./...`
- ✅ All tests pass: `go test ./...` (9 packages)

**Result**: FilterResult type ready for use in filtering pipeline

---

### Task 2: Create Audit Export Module

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Time**: 2025-10-20

**Goal**: Create internal/audit package with SaveAuditJSON function

**Changes Made**:
1. Created `internal/audit/export.go`:
   - AuditFile struct: top-level audit file structure
   - AuditPipeline struct: per-pipeline stats and events
   - SaveAuditJSON function: exports complete audit trail to JSON
   - processCulturalEvents/processCityEvents: calculate stats and breakdown
   - Atomic writes: temp file + rename for safety

2. Created `internal/audit/export_test.go`:
   - TestSaveAuditJSON: end-to-end file creation and parsing
   - TestProcessCulturalEvents: filter breakdown calculation
   - TestProcessCityEvents: city events processing
   - 3 tests covering all functionality

**Verification**:
- ✅ Build successful: `go build ./...`
- ✅ Audit tests pass: `go test ./internal/audit/...` (3 tests)
- ✅ All tests pass: `go test ./...` (10 packages)

**Result**: Audit export module ready to integrate into build pipeline
