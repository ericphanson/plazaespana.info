### Task 3: Define Event Types (TDD)
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Completed:** 2025-10-19
**Commit:** af867f3

**Steps Completed:**
1. ✅ Wrote failing test in `internal/fetch/types_test.go`
2. ✅ Ran test to verify failure (undefined: JSONResponse, RawEvent)
3. ✅ Wrote minimal implementation in `internal/fetch/types.go`
4. ✅ Fixed JSON tag issue (removed ,string from float64 fields)
5. ✅ Ran test to verify success - all tests pass

**Files Created:**
- `internal/fetch/types_test.go` - Test for RawEvent and JSONResponse types
- `internal/fetch/types.go` - Event type definitions matching Madrid API structure

**Test Results:**
```
Initial run: FAIL (expected - undefined types)
After implementation: FAIL (JSON unmarshal error - ,string tag on float64)
After fix: PASS
- TestEvent_UnmarshalJSON: PASS
- TestRawEvent_Fields: PASS
```

**Implementation Details:**
- `RawEvent` struct with fields matching Madrid API (ID-EVENTO, TITULO, etc.)
- Support for both JSON and XML tags for multi-format fallback
- `JSONResponse` wraps JSON-LD structure with @context and @graph
- Coordinates stored as float64 (not string) for direct JSON unmarshaling

**Issues Encountered:**
- Initial implementation used `json:"COORDENADA-LATITUD,string"` tag which is invalid for unmarshaling numeric values
- Fixed by removing `,string` modifier - Madrid API provides coordinates as numbers

---

### Task 6: CSV Fetch Fallback (TDD)
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Completed:** 2025-10-19
**Commit:** 192fec5

**Steps Completed:**
1. ✅ Wrote failing tests in `internal/fetch/client_test.go` (TestClient_FetchCSV_Semicolon and TestClient_FetchCSV_Comma)
2. ✅ Ran test to verify failure (undefined: FetchCSV)
3. ✅ Added `bytes` and `encoding/csv` imports to `internal/fetch/client.go`

6. ✅ Ran test to verify success - all tests pass

**Files Modified:**
- Modified: `internal/fetch/client_test.go` - Added TestClient_FetchCSV_Semicolon and TestClient_FetchCSV_Comma
- Modified: `internal/fetch/client.go` - Added FetchCSV method, parseCSV and getField helper functions

**Test Results:**
```
Initial run: FAIL (expected - undefined: FetchCSV)
After initial implementation: FAIL (TestClient_FetchCSV_Comma failing - empty event data)
After delimiter validation fix: PASS
- TestNewClient: PASS (0.00s)
- TestClient_FetchWithUserAgent: PASS (0.00s)
- TestClient_FetchXML: PASS (0.00s) [from Task 5]
- TestClient_FetchCSV_Semicolon: PASS (0.00s) [NEW]
- TestClient_FetchCSV_Comma: PASS (0.00s) [NEW]
- TestEvent_UnmarshalJSON: PASS (0.00s) [from Task 3]
- TestRawEvent_Fields: PASS (0.00s) [from Task 3]
Total: 7/7 tests passing
```

**Implementation Details:**
- `FetchCSV()` method that:
  - Creates HTTP request with User-Agent header
  - Handles HTTP errors (non-200 status codes)
  - Reads response body into memory
  - Tries semicolon delimiter first (Madrid's preferred format)
  - Falls back to comma delimiter if semicolon fails or produces no events
  - Returns []RawEvent or error with context
- `parseCSV()` helper function that:
  - Parses CSV with specified delimiter
  - Builds header map from first row
  - Validates presence of ID-EVENTO column (detects wrong delimiter usage)
  - Parses coordinates using fmt.Sscanf
  - Returns []RawEvent or error
- `getField()` helper function for safe column access by name
- Supports both semicolon (;) and comma (,) delimiters with automatic fallback

**Issues Encountered:**
- Initial implementation had a subtle bug: when parsing comma-delimited CSV with semicolon delimiter, the CSV parser still "succeeds" but treats entire lines as single fields
- This caused the semicolon parse to return 2 records (header + data) but with only 1 field each containing the full comma-separated line
- The headerMap would not contain "ID-EVENTO" as a separate key
- Fixed by adding validation: check if "ID-EVENTO" column exists in headerMap before processing data rows
- This ensures the fallback mechanism works correctly by detecting incorrect delimiter usage

**Test Results:**
```
Initial run: FAIL (expected - undefined: HaversineDistance, undefined: WithinRadius)
After implementation: PASS
- TestHaversineDistance/Same_point: PASS (0.00s) [distance: 0.0 km]
- TestHaversineDistance/Plaza_de_España_to_nearby_point_(~350m): PASS (0.00s) [distance: ~0.35 km]
- TestHaversineDistance/Plaza_de_España_to_far_point_(~5km): PASS (0.00s) [distance: ~5.0 km]

- TestWithinRadius/Just_inside: PASS (0.00s) [within 0.35 km radius]
- TestWithinRadius/Far_away: PASS (0.00s) [outside 0.35 km radius]
Total: 6/6 tests passing in 0.002s
```

**Implementation Details:**
- `HaversineDistance()` function that:
  - Calculates great-circle distance between two GPS coordinates
  - Uses Haversine formula: a = sin²(Δlat/2) + cos(lat1) × cos(lat2) × sin²(Δlon/2)
  - Returns distance in kilometers (Earth radius: 6371.0 km)
  - Converts degrees to radians for trigonometric calculations
- `WithinRadius()` function that:
  - Checks if distance between two points ≤ specified radius
  - Returns boolean result
  - Wraps HaversineDistance for convenience
- Constants: `earthRadiusKm = 6371.0` (standard Earth radius in kilometers)
- All calculations use float64 precision for accuracy

**Test Coverage:**
- Same point (0 km distance) - validates algorithm handles identical coordinates
- Nearby point (~350m) - validates accuracy at Plaza de España filter radius (0.35 km)
- Far point (~5 km) - validates accuracy at larger distances
- Radius checks for points inside and outside filter boundary
- Uses tolerance thresholds to account for floating-point precision

**Issues Encountered:** None - implementation followed TDD approach exactly as planned, all tests passed on first try

- TestIsInFuture: PASS (0.00s) [future/past time comparison]
Total: 4/4 new tests passing + 6 from Task 7 = 10/10 tests passing in 0.002s
```

**Implementation Details:**
- `ParseEventDateTime()` function that:
  - Parses Madrid API date format (DD/MM/YYYY)
  - Supports optional time in HH:MM format
  - Uses ParseInLocation with Europe/Madrid timezone
  - Layout: "02/01/2006" for dates, "02/01/2006 15:04" for date+time
  - Concatenates fecha and hora when time is provided
  - Returns time.Time in specified timezone or error with context
- `IsInFuture()` function that:
  - Compares event time against reference time (typically now)
  - Returns boolean result using time.After()
  - Enables filtering of past events
- Timezone-aware: All times parsed to Europe/Madrid to handle DST correctly
- Handles all-day events: Empty hora field treated as midnight (start of day)

**Test Coverage:**
- Valid date with time (15/11/2025 19:30) - validates full datetime parsing
- Valid date without time (20/11/2025) - validates all-day event handling
- Invalid date format (2025-11-15) - validates error handling for wrong format
- Future/past comparison - validates IsInFuture logic with 24-hour offsets
- Timezone verification - ensures parsed times are in Europe/Madrid location

**Issues Encountered:** None - implementation followed TDD approach exactly as planned, all tests passed on first try

- `DeduplicateByID()` function that:
  - Accepts []fetch.RawEvent slice
  - Removes duplicates based on ID-EVENTO field
  - Keeps first occurrence of each unique ID
  - Skips events with empty ID-EVENTO (defensive)
  - Uses map[string]bool to track seen IDs
  - Returns new slice with unique events only
  - Preserves original order of first occurrences
- Algorithm: O(n) time complexity with single pass through events
- Memory: O(k) where k is number of unique event IDs
