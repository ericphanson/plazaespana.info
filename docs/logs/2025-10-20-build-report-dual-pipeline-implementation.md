# Build Report Dual Pipeline Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Plan**: docs/plans/2025-10-20-009-build-report-dual-pipeline.md
**Status**: In Progress

## Objective

Update HTML build report to track both cultural events pipeline (datos.madrid.es) and city events pipeline (esmadrid.com) separately with clear metrics for each.

## Implementation Log

### Task 1: Update Data Structures

**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
**Time**: 2025-10-20 14:10 - 14:12

**Goal**: Add `PipelineReport`, `PipelineFetchReport`, `PipelineFilterReport` and update `BuildReport` struct

**Changes Made**:
- Replaced `FetchReport` with `PipelineFetchReport` (supports multiple attempts)
- Replaced `ProcessingReport` with `PipelineFilterReport` (modular filters)
- Added `PipelineReport` to track each pipeline separately
- Added `CategoryFilterStats` for city events filtering
- Added `DistrictoFilterStats` for cultural events filtering
- Updated `BuildReport` with `CulturalPipeline` and `CityPipeline` fields
- Removed legacy `EventsCount`, `Fetching`, `Processing` fields (clean break)
- Kept `TotalEvents` as sum of both pipelines
- Kept `MergeStats` but moved to cultural pipeline only (optional field)

**Backward Compatibility**: ‚ùå BROKEN (as planned - clean slate)

**Result**: New dual pipeline structure ready for use

### Task 2: Update HTML Rendering

**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
**Time**: 2025-10-20 14:12 - 14:18

**Goal**: Rewrite HTML report to display both pipelines with clear visual distinction

**Changes Made**:
- Complete rewrite of `internal/report/html.go` (343 lines ‚Üí 546 lines)
- Added CSS variables for pipeline colors: `--cultural` (purple) and `--city` (orange)
- Dark mode support for all colors
- Responsive grid layout for pipeline overview cards

**HTML Structure**:
1. Build Summary - Total stats (time, duration, status, total events)
2. Pipeline Overview - Side-by-side cards with key metrics
3. Cultural Events Pipeline - Detailed section with:
   - Data fetching (JSON/XML/CSV attempts)
   - Deduplication stats
   - Distrito filtering
   - Geographic filtering
   - Time filtering
4. City Events Pipeline - Detailed section with:
   - Data fetching (XML only)
   - Geographic filtering
   - Category filtering
   - Time filtering
5. Output Files - HTML/JSON paths
6. Warnings - If any

**Visual Design**:
- Purple accent (üé≠) for cultural events
- Orange accent (üéâ) for city events
- Cards with colored left borders
- Emoji icons for visual clarity
- Mobile-responsive grid layouts

**Result**: Clean, modern HTML report showing both pipelines clearly
