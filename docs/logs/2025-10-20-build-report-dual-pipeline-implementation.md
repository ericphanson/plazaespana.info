### Task 1: Update Data Structures

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Time**: 2025-10-20 14:10 - 14:12

**Goal**: Add `PipelineReport`, `PipelineFetchReport`, `PipelineFilterReport` and update `BuildReport` struct

**Changes Made**:
- Replaced `FetchReport` with `PipelineFetchReport` (supports multiple attempts)
- Replaced `ProcessingReport` with `PipelineFilterReport` (modular filters)
- Added `PipelineReport` to track each pipeline separately
- Added `CategoryFilterStats` for city events filtering
- Added `DistrictoFilterStats` for cultural events filtering
- Updated `BuildReport` with `CulturalPipeline` and `CityPipeline` fields
- Removed legacy `EventsCount`, `Fetching`, `Processing` fields (clean break)
- Kept `TotalEvents` as sum of both pipelines
- Kept `MergeStats` but moved to cultural pipeline only (optional field)

**Backward Compatibility**: ❌ BROKEN (as planned - clean slate)

**Result**: New dual pipeline structure ready for use
