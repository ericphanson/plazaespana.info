## Data Source Comparison

| Source | URL | Event Count | Content Type | Plaza Outdoor Events? |
|--------|-----|-------------|--------------|----------------------|
| datos.madrid.es | 300107-0-agenda-actividades-eventos.{json,xml,csv} | 1,055 | Cultural centers | ❌ No |
| esmadrid.com | agenda_v1_es.xml | 1,158 | Tourism (cultural centers) | ❌ No |

**Key Finding:** ESMadrid.com and datos.madrid.es appear to pull from the **same underlying database**. The ~100 event difference is likely due to:
- Different update times
- Different filtering criteria
- Tourism-focused curation

---

## Conclusion

**ESMadrid.com tourism feed does NOT solve the problem.**

### What it Contains:
✅ Cultural center events (same as datos.madrid.es)  
✅ GPS coordinates for most events  
✅ Rich metadata (categories, dates, descriptions)  
✅ Tourism-oriented presentation

### What it's Missing:
❌ Outdoor events at Plaza de España  
❌ Gaming events (Riot LOL, etc.)  
❌ Outdoor cinema at the plaza  
❌ Weekend public square programming  
❌ Any events AT the plaza square itself

---

## Root Cause Analysis

**Why Plaza outdoor events aren't in ANY feed:**

### Hypothesis 1: Private Event Organization
Plaza outdoor events (Riot Games, outdoor cinema, concerts) may be organized by:
- Private companies (gaming companies, film distributors, event promoters)
- Sponsorship deals (Red Bull, brands)
- NOT by Madrid city government

**These events may NOT be in official cultural programming databases.**

### Hypothesis 2: Different Administrative System
Public square events may be managed by:
- Parks & Recreation department (not Culture department)
- Special events permits office
- Tourism promotion office (but not published to event feeds)
- Different internal system

### Hypothesis 3: Short-Notice Publishing
Plaza events might be:
- Published closer to event date (not weeks in advance)
- Updated irregularly (not systematic like museum programming)
- Announced via social media only (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook)

---

## Recommendations

Since both datos.madrid.es and esmadrid.com feeds contain the SAME type of events (cultural center programming) and NEITHER has Plaza outdoor events, we have these options:

### Option A: Pivot Site Focus ✅ **RECOMMENDED**
Change site to match available data:
- **"Cultural Events Near Plaza de España"**
- **"Museums, Theaters & Cultural Centers in Centro/Moncloa"**

**Pros:**
- Works perfectly with existing implementation (142 events)
- Reliable data source (updated regularly)
- Low maintenance
- **Already built and working!**

**Cons:**
- Doesn't match original user intent (Plaza outdoor events)

---

### Option B: Web Scraping
Scrape madrid.es website or social media for Plaza events

**Pros:**
- May find events not in APIs

**Cons:**
- Fragile (HTML changes break scraper)
- Rate limiting / blocking risk
- High maintenance burden
- May still not find Plaza outdoor events

---

### Option C: Manual Curation
Weekly manual check + static JSON file for Plaza events

**Pros:**
- Guaranteed accuracy for Plaza events
- Can include events from any source

**Cons:**
- Manual work (not automated)
- Not sustainable long-term
- Requires weekly maintenance

---

### Option D: Contact Madrid City Government
Email `datos@madrid.es` to ask where Plaza outdoor events data is published

**Pros:**
- Official answer from source
- May discover hidden/undocumented API

**Cons:**
- Slow (days/weeks for response)
- No guarantee of API access
- May not exist

---

## Next Steps

**User decision required:**

1. **Accept Option A** (pivot to "Cultural Events Near Plaza de España")  
   → Site is production-ready, 142 events, working perfectly

2. **Pursue Option B/C/D** to find Plaza outdoor events  
   → Significant additional work, uncertain outcome

3. **Hybrid approach**: Keep current site + manually add Plaza outdoor events when found  
   → Best of both worlds, minimal extra work

---

## Files

- **Downloaded feed:** `/workspace/test/fixtures/esmadrid-agenda.xml` (4.5 MB)
- **Firewall updated:** `.devcontainer/init-firewall.sh` (esmadrid.com allowed)

---

## Conclusion Summary

ESMadrid.com tourism feed is **NOT the solution**. It contains the same cultural center events as datos.madrid.es. Plaza de España outdoor events (movies, concerts, gaming) are not published in any official Madrid event API we've tested.

**Recommendation:** Pivot site to "Cultural Events Near Plaza de España" and deploy current working implementation.
