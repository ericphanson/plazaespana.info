# Multi-Venue Plaza de España Implementation Log

**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Plan:** docs/plans/2025-10-20-014-include-multivenue-plaza-espana-implementation.md
**Status:** In Progress

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Text Matching Infrastructure

#### Task 1.1: Add Text Normalization and Matching Helper (30 min)
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Started:** 2025-10-20
**Completed:** 2025-10-20

**Goal:** Create utility function to match "Plaza de España" variants (accent-insensitive).

**Files modified:**
- `internal/filter/text.go` - Added three new functions:
  - `normalizeText()` - Removes accents, converts to lowercase, collapses whitespace
  - `plazaEspanaVariants()` - Returns list of 11 normalized variants
  - `MatchesPlazaEspana()` - Main matching function across all text fields
- `internal/filter/text_test.go` - Added three test functions:
  - `TestNormalizeText` - 6 test cases for normalization
  - `TestMatchesPlazaEspana` - 13 test cases for Plaza de España matching
  - `TestPlazaEspanaVariants` - Validation of variants list

**Test Results:**
```
=== RUN   TestNormalizeText
--- PASS: TestNormalizeText (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestMatchesPlazaEspana
--- PASS: TestMatchesPlazaEspana (0.01s)
    --- PASS: TestMatchesPlazaEspana/title_with_accent
    --- PASS: TestMatchesPlazaEspana/title_without_accent
    --- PASS: TestMatchesPlazaEspana/description_abbreviated
    --- PASS: TestMatchesPlazaEspana/venue_field
    --- PASS: TestMatchesPlazaEspana/no_mention
    --- PASS: TestMatchesPlazaEspana/historical_reference
    --- PASS: TestMatchesPlazaEspana/multi_venue
    --- PASS: TestMatchesPlazaEspana/uppercase_variant
    --- PASS: TestMatchesPlazaEspana/address_field
    --- PASS: TestMatchesPlazaEspana/different_plaza
    --- PASS: TestMatchesPlazaEspana/abbreviated_plz
    --- PASS: TestMatchesPlazaEspana/abbreviated_pl_no_period
    --- PASS: TestMatchesPlazaEspana/combined_fields
=== RUN   TestPlazaEspanaVariants
--- PASS: TestPlazaEspanaVariants (0.00s)
PASS
```

**Notes:**
- golang.org/x/text dependency already present in go.mod
- All tests passing (100% success rate)
- Ready to proceed to Phase 2

### Phase 2: FilterResult Extension

#### Task 2.1: Extend FilterResult with Text Matching Fields (15 min)
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Started:** 2025-10-20
**Completed:** 2025-10-20

**Goal:** Add fields to track text-based Plaza de España matching.

**Files modified:**
- `internal/event/types.go` - Extended FilterResult struct with two new fields:
  - `PlazaEspanaText bool` - Tracks Plaza de España text mentions
  - `MultiVenueKept bool` - Indicates event kept via text (not geo)

**Notes:**
- Fields added to "Location filtering - text matching" section
- Both fields use `omitempty` JSON tags for cleaner audit output
- Backward compatible (additive change only)

### Phase 3: City Events Filtering Logic

#### Task 3.1: Update City Events Filtering to Include Text Matching (45 min)
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Started:** 2025-10-20
**Completed:** 2025-10-20

**Goal:** Modify city events filtering to keep events that mention Plaza de España, even if outside radius.

**Files modified:**
- `cmd/buildsite/main.go` - Updated city events filtering logic (lines 551-652):
  - Added `cityMultiVenueKept` counter
  - Check Plaza de España text in all events using `filter.MatchesPlazaEspana()`
  - Updated filtering decision tree:
    - No coordinates + text match → keep as multi-venue (if not too old)
    - Has coordinates + within radius → keep by geo (preferred)
    - Has coordinates + outside radius + text match → keep as multi-venue (if not too old)
    - All other cases → filter out with appropriate reason
  - Set `MultiVenueKept` flag and filter reason for text-matched events
  - Updated logging to show geo vs text kept breakdown

**Filter Logic Priority:**
1. Check coordinates presence
2. Check time filter (too old)
3. For events with coordinates: geo radius takes precedence over text
4. For events without coordinates: text matching provides fallback
5. Text-matched events marked with `filter_reason = "kept (multi-venue: Plaza de España)"`

**Logging:**
```
City events after filtering: N events (X by geo, Y by Plaza de España text match)
```

**Test Results:**
- All existing tests pass
- Code compiles successfully
- No regressions

**Notes:**
- Text matching only applied to city events (not cultural events)
- Geo filtering remains primary method (within 350m radius)
- Multi-venue matching is additive (doesn't break existing behavior)

### Phase 4: Build Report Integration

#### Task 4.1: Add Multi-Venue Stats to Build Report (20 min)
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Started:** 2025-10-20
**Completed:** 2025-10-20

**Goal:** Track and display multi-venue kept events in build report.

**Files modified:**
- `internal/report/types.go` - Extended GeoFilterStats struct:
  - Added `MultiVenueKept int` field with JSON tag `multi_venue_kept,omitempty`
  - Comment indicates "City events only: kept via Plaza de España text match"
- `cmd/buildsite/main.go` - Populated multi-venue stats:
  - Added `MultiVenueKept: cityMultiVenueKept` to GeoFilterStats initialization
  - This tracks count of events kept via text matching

**Build Report Structure:**
```json
{
  "city_pipeline": {
    "filtering": {
      "geo_filter": {
        "kept": N,
        "multi_venue_kept": Y  // NEW: subset of kept that are text-matched
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Notes:**
- Field uses `omitempty` tag (won't appear for cultural events where it's 0)
- Backward compatible (additive field only)
- Provides visibility into text-matching effectiveness
