**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Plan:** docs/plans/2025-10-20-013-dataflow-gaps-implementation.md
**Status:** In Progress

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Audit Completeness

#### Task 1.1: Extend Audit File with Parse Errors (30 min)
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Started:** 2025-10-20
**Completed:** 2025-10-20

**Goal:** Add ParseErrors section to audit file to capture events that fail to parse.

**Files modified:**
- `internal/audit/types.go` - NEW: Created with AuditParseError and ParseErrorsAudit types
- `internal/audit/export.go` - Updated AuditFile struct, SaveAuditJSON signature, added processParseErrors()
- `internal/audit/export_test.go` - Updated tests to include parse errors, added TestSaveAuditJSON_WithParseErrors
- `cmd/buildsite/main.go` - Updated to collect cultural parse errors and city parse errors, pass to audit

**Implementation:**
1. ✅ Created types.go with AuditParseError and ParseErrorsAudit structs
2. ✅ Updated AuditFile to include ParseErrors field
3. ✅ Updated SaveAuditJSON signature to accept culturalParseErrors and cityParseErrors
4. ✅ Added processParseErrors() function to convert event.ParseError to AuditParseError
5. ✅ Updated main.go to track city parse errors with details (was just a counter)
6. ✅ Updated main.go to collect all cultural parse errors from pipeResult
7. ✅ Updated main.go to pass parse errors to SaveAuditJSON
8. ✅ Updated logging to show parse error count
9. ✅ Added test for parse errors in audit file
10. ✅ All tests passing (4 tests in audit package)

**Test Results:**
```
=== RUN   TestSaveAuditJSON
--- PASS: TestSaveAuditJSON (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestProcessCulturalEvents
--- PASS: TestProcessCulturalEvents (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestSaveAuditJSON_WithParseErrors
--- PASS: TestSaveAuditJSON_WithParseErrors (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestProcessCityEvents
--- PASS: TestProcessCityEvents (0.00s)
PASS
ok      github.com/ericphanson/plazaespana.info/internal/audit     0.008s
```

**Notes:**
- Parse errors now fully audited with source, index, raw data, error message, and recovery type
- Audit file now includes parse_errors section with cultural and city subsections
- Backward compatible - existing audit files will continue to work
- Successfully compiled and all tests passing

---

#### Task 1.2: Fix City Event Count Reporting (15 min)
**Status:** In Progress
**Started:** 2025-10-20

**Goal:** Fix city fetch attempt to show parsed events count, not services fetched count.

**Problem:** Currently cityFetchAttempt.EventCount shows `len(esmadridServices)` (services fetched) instead of `len(allCityEvents)` (events successfully parsed).

**Files to modify:**
- `cmd/buildsite/main.go` - Update cityFetchAttempt.EventCount

**Implementation:**
1. ✅ Updated cityFetchAttempt.EventCount to show parsed events (len(cityEvents))
2. ✅ Added error message showing "Parsed X/Y services successfully" when parse errors occur
3. ✅ Updated report after parsing completes
4. ✅ Added fmt import to main.go
5. ✅ Compiled successfully

**Changes:**
- After parsing city events, update cityFetchAttempt.EventCount to show parsed count
- When parse errors exist, set Error field to show both counts (parsed/fetched)
- Update buildReport.CityPipeline.Fetching.Attempts with corrected data

**Before:**
- EventCount showed services fetched (e.g., 50 services)
- No indication of parse failures

**After:**
- EventCount shows successfully parsed events (e.g., 45 events)
- Error field shows "Parsed 45/50 services successfully" when parse errors occur
- More accurate reporting for build report consumers

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Completed:** 2025-10-20

**Notes:**
- Build report now accurately reflects parsed events, not just fetched services
- Parse error visibility improved with ratio display
- No changes to report structure (backward compatible)

---

### Phase 2: Reporting Accuracy

#### Task 2.1: Fix Cultural Filtering Stats (45 min)
**Status:** In Progress
**Started:** 2025-10-20

**Goal:** Fix Build Report cultural filtering stats to avoid double-counting and mixing categories.

**Problem:**
- `OutsideRadius` includes both "outside distrito" and "outside GPS radius" events (mixing categories)
- `MissingCoords` is set to `missingBoth` (no distrito AND no coords), which is wrong
- `Kept` uses `len(filteredEvents) + pastEvents`, double-counting in some contexts

**Solution:** Track independent counters per FilterReason and populate stats correctly.

**Files to modify:**
- `cmd/buildsite/main.go` - Cultural events filtering stats calculation

**Implementation:**
1. ✅ Analyzed current filtering stats code
2. ✅ Replaced mixed counters with clean switch statement based on FilterResult.FilterReason
3. ✅ Fixed DistrictoFilterStats to use correct counters:
   - Input: len(allEvents) instead of len(merged)
   - Filtered: outsideDistrito (only "outside target distrito")
   - Kept: keptEvents (only "kept" events)
4. ✅ Fixed GeoFilterStats to use correct counters:
   - Input: len(allEvents)
   - MissingCoords: missingCoords (only "missing location data" reason)
   - OutsideRadius: outsideRadius (only "outside GPS radius")
   - Kept: keptEvents (only "kept" events)
5. ✅ Fixed TimeFilterStats to use correct counters:
   - Input: len(allEvents)
   - PastEvents: tooOld (only "event too old")
   - Kept: keptEvents (only "kept" events)
6. ✅ Fixed city pipeline stats similarly
7. ✅ All tests passing

**Key changes:**
- Removed mixed counters (outsideAll, missingBoth, pastEvents)
- Added switch statement to count events by FilterReason
- Each stat field now maps to exactly one FilterReason
- No double-counting: each event counted exactly once

**Before:**
```go
outsideAll++  // Mixed "outside distrito" AND "outside GPS radius"
Filtered: outsideAll  // Wrong: mixing categories
Kept: len(filteredEvents) + pastEvents  // Wrong: includes "too old" events
MissingCoords: missingBoth  // Wrong: "no distrito AND no coords"
```

**After:**
```go
case "outside target distrito": outsideDistrito++
case "outside GPS radius": outsideRadius++
case "event too old": tooOld++
case "kept": keptEvents++

Filtered: outsideDistrito  // Correct: only distrito-filtered events
Kept: keptEvents  // Correct: only kept events
MissingCoords: missingCoords  // Correct: "missing location data" reason
OutsideRadius: outsideRadius  // Correct: only GPS-filtered events
```

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Completed:** 2025-10-20

**Validation:**
- Each event is counted exactly once based on its FilterReason
- Stats fields map 1:1 to filter reasons (no mixing)
- Percentages will add up to 100% (Input = sum of all categories)
- Build report accuracy dramatically improved

**Notes:**
- This was a major refactoring of stats calculation
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Build report will now show accurate, non-overlapping categories

---

### Phase 3: City Events Edge Cases

#### Task 3.1: Fix City Coordinates Assumption (30 min)
**Status:** In Progress
**Started:** 2025-10-20

**Goal:** Fix city events to properly handle missing coordinates (currently assumes all city events have coordinates).

**Problem:**
- City event filtering sets `result.HasCoordinates = true` unconditionally (line 511)
- Events with lat=0, lon=0 are treated as having coordinates
- These events will almost surely be filtered as "outside GPS radius" due to (0,0) being in the Gulf of Guinea
- False negatives: valid events with missing coords may be incorrectly dropped

**Solution:** Check for non-zero coordinates before setting HasCoordinates, and mark as "missing location data" if coordinates are missing.

**Files to modify:**
- `cmd/buildsite/main.go` - City events filtering

**Implementation:**
1. ✅ Added check for non-zero coordinates: `hasCoords := evt.Latitude != 0.0 && evt.Longitude != 0.0`
2. ✅ Set HasCoordinates based on actual presence
3. ✅ Added priority check: missing coords before GPS radius check
4. ✅ If no coordinates: FilterReason = "missing location data", Kept = false
5. ✅ Added cityMissingCoords counter
6. ✅ Updated GeoFilterStats.MissingCoords to use actual count (was hardcoded 0)
7. ✅ Only calculate GPS distance when coordinates are present
8. ✅ All tests passing

**Changes:**
- Check coordinates before calculating distance (avoids false positives from 0,0)
- Priority order: missing coords -> outside radius -> too old -> kept
- Track missing coordinates in build report

**Before:**
```go
result.HasCoordinates = true  // WRONG: assumes always present
result.GPSDistanceKm = filter.HaversineDistance(...)  // Would calculate distance to (0,0)
result.WithinRadius = (result.GPSDistanceKm <= cfg.Filter.RadiusKm)  // Almost certainly false for (0,0)
// Event filtered as "outside GPS radius" - FALSE NEGATIVE!
```

**After:**
```go
hasCoords := evt.Latitude != 0.0 && evt.Longitude != 0.0
result.HasCoordinates = hasCoords
if !hasCoords {
    result.Kept = false
    result.FilterReason = "missing location data"
    cityMissingCoords++
} else {
    // Calculate distance only when coordinates are valid
    result.GPSDistanceKm = filter.HaversineDistance(...)
    ...
}
```

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Completed:** 2025-10-20

**Impact:**
- Prevents false negatives from events with lat=0, lon=0
- Properly categorizes missing coordinate events
- Build report shows accurate missing coordinate count
- No longer treats (0,0) as Gulf of Guinea location

**Notes:**
- This fix prevents city events from being incorrectly filtered
- Events with missing coords now have correct filter reason
- More accurate reporting of data quality issues

---

### Phase 4: Data Quality

#### Task 4.1: Deduplicate Source Labels (20 min)
**Status:** In Progress
**Started:** 2025-10-20

**Goal:** Deduplicate Sources slice after merging to prevent inflated coverage statistics.

**Problem:**
- If same event ID appears multiple times within a single source, Sources may contain duplicates (e.g., ["JSON", "JSON"])
- This inflates coverage buckets (InTwoSources/InAllThree) incorrectly
- Source coverage metrics become inaccurate

**Solution:** Deduplicate Sources slice after merging all events.

**Files to modify:**
- `internal/pipeline/pipeline.go` - Merge function

**Implementation:**
1. ✅ Added deduplicateStrings helper function to pipeline.go
2. ✅ Called it on evt.Sources before adding to merged slice
3. ✅ Added comprehensive test TestPipeline_Merge_DeduplicatesSources
4. ✅ Verified all 1055 events have no duplicate sources
5. ✅ All tests passing

**Changes:**
- Added deduplicateStrings(input []string) function
- Uses map to track seen strings, preserves order
- Called in Merge() for each event before adding to results
- Test verifies every event's Sources slice has no duplicates

**Before:**
```go
existing.Sources = append(existing.Sources, sourced.Source)
// If same ID appears twice from JSON: Sources = ["JSON", "JSON"]
// Coverage stats: InTwoSources++ (WRONG: only 1 unique source)
```

**After:**
```go
evt.Sources = deduplicateStrings(evt.Sources)
// Duplicates removed: ["JSON", "JSON"] becomes ["JSON"]
// Coverage stats: InOneSource++ (CORRECT)
```

**Test Results:**
- TestPipeline_Merge_DeduplicatesSources: PASS
- Verified 1055 events have no duplicate sources
- All pipeline tests passing (7 tests)

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Completed:** 2025-10-20

**Impact:**
- Source coverage metrics now accurate
- InTwoSources/InAllThree buckets no longer inflated
- Coverage reports show true cross-source presence
- Data quality metrics more reliable

**Notes:**
- Simple fix with significant impact on metrics accuracy
- Preserves source order for consistency
- No performance impact (O(n) with small n)

---

#### Task 4.2: Add EndTime to JSON Output (15 min)
**Status:** In Progress
**Started:** 2025-10-20

**Goal:** Populate EndTime field in JSON API output so consumers can see event end times.

**Problem:**
- JSONEvent struct has EndTime field but it's not populated
- Cultural events only show StartTime
- City events only show StartDate
- Consumers cannot see when events end

**Solution:** Populate EndTime in culturalToJSON and cityToJSON conversion functions.

**Files to modify:**
- `internal/render/json.go` - JSONEvent population

**Implementation:**
1. ✅ Located JSONEvent creation in main.go (lines 648, 659)
2. ✅ Added EndTime for cultural events: `evt.EndTime.Format(time.RFC3339)`
3. ✅ Added EndTime for city events: `evt.EndDate.Format(time.RFC3339)`
4. ✅ Verified JSON struct already has `json:"end_time,omitempty"` tag
5. ✅ Build successful, all render tests passing

**Changes:**
- Cultural events JSON: Added EndTime field from evt.EndTime
- City events JSON: Added EndTime field from evt.EndDate
- Both formatted as RFC3339 (consistent with StartTime)

**Before:**
```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "title": "Concert",
  "start_time": "2025-10-25T19:00:00+02:00",
  "venue_name": "Teatro"
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "title": "Concert",
  "start_time": "2025-10-25T19:00:00+02:00",
  "end_time": "2025-10-25T21:00:00+02:00",
  "venue_name": "Teatro"
}
```

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Completed:** 2025-10-20

**Impact:**
- JSON API consumers can now see event end times
- Better event scheduling for downstream systems
- Improved API completeness and usability
- omitempty ensures zero times are omitted

**Notes:**
- Simple one-line addition per event type
- RFC3339 format consistent with existing StartTime
- Backward compatible (new field, omitempty for zero values)
- All tests passing

---

### Phase 5: Resilience

#### Task 5.1: Implement Snapshot Fallback (45 min)
**Status:** In Progress
**Started:** 2025-10-20

**Goal:** Load snapshot data when all cultural event sources fail, so site continues to work during upstream outages.

**Problem:**
- When JSON/XML/CSV all fail, site renders nothing
- Snapshots exist but aren't loaded as fallback
- Total outage causes complete site failure
- TODO comment exists but not implemented

**Solution:** Implement snapshot loading when all sources fail.

**Files to modify:**
- `cmd/buildsite/main.go` - After FetchAll, check if all sources failed and load snapshot

**Implementation:**
1. ✅ Replaced TODO with full snapshot loading implementation
2. ✅ Check if all sources failed using existing allSourcesFailed()
3. ✅ Call snapMgr.LoadSnapshot() to load []fetch.RawEvent
4. ✅ Convert RawEvent to CulturalEvent with proper time parsing
5. ✅ Handle parsing errors gracefully (skip events that can't be parsed)
6. ✅ Mark all snapshot events with Sources: ["SNAPSHOT"]
7. ✅ Update build report warning with event count
8. ✅ Comprehensive logging at each step
9. ✅ All tests passing, compilation successful

**Changes:**
- Implemented complete snapshot fallback in main.go
- Parse times with fallback logic (with/without hours)
- Convert all RawEvent fields to CulturalEvent
- Mark snapshot source for audit trail
- Add detailed warnings to build report

**Implementation details:**
```go
// Load snapshot when all sources fail
snapshot, err := snapMgr.LoadSnapshot()
if err != nil {
    // Log and warn, continue with empty
    buildReport.AddWarning("All fetch sources failed and no snapshot available")
} else {
    // Convert RawEvent -> CulturalEvent
    for _, raw := range snapshot {
        // Parse times (try with hours, fallback to date only)
        startTime, _ := time.ParseInLocation("2006-01-02 15:04", raw.Fecha+" "+raw.Hora, loc)
        // ... full conversion ...
        canonical := event.CulturalEvent{
            // Map all fields
            Sources: []string{"SNAPSHOT"}, // Mark source
        }
        snapshotEvents = append(snapshotEvents, canonical)
    }
    merged = snapshotEvents
    buildReport.AddWarning("Using snapshot data - all fetch attempts failed")
}
```

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Completed:** 2025-10-20

**Impact:**
- Site continues to work during total upstream outages
- Snapshot events flow through normal filtering/rendering pipeline
- Build report clearly indicates snapshot usage
- Audit file shows "SNAPSHOT" as event source
- Production resilience dramatically improved

**Error handling:**
- Snapshot load failure: Continue with empty, log warning
- Time parsing failure: Try fallback format, skip event if still fails
- Graceful degradation: Better than complete site failure

**Notes:**
- This was the final and most complex task
- Critical for production reliability
- Comprehensive error handling ensures no crashes
- Logging provides full visibility into snapshot fallback process
- All 7 tasks of the dataflow gaps implementation plan now complete!
