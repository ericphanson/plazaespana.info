# Filter Analysis Investigation

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Investigator**: Claude Code
**Issue**: Are we filtering out events AT Plaza de Espa√±a?

## Objective

Determine if our filtering pipeline is too aggressive and excluding events that actually happen at or near Plaza de Espa√±a.

## Current Filter Pipeline

1. **Distrito Filter** - Keep only events in CENTRO or MONCLOA-ARAVACA
2. **Geographic Filter** - Keep only events within 0.35km of Plaza de Espa√±a
3. **Time Filter** - Keep only future events (started <60 days ago)

**Current Results**:
- Input: 1001 events (after deduplication)
- After distrito: 158 events
- After time: 137 events
- **Filtered out: 864 events (86.3%)**

## Investigation Questions

1. Are we filtering events that happen AT Plaza de Espa√±a?
2. Are we filtering events at nearby venues (Templo de Debod, Parque del Oeste)?
3. Is the distrito filter too strict?
4. Is the time filter too aggressive (60-day cutoff)?

## Methodology

Add detailed logging to each filter stage to capture:
- Event title, venue, location
- Distrito (if available)
- GPS coordinates (if available)
- Filter reason (why rejected)

Run full build and analyze rejected events.

## Data Collection

Ran instrumented build with detailed logging for each filter stage. Captured 1001 events after deduplication.

### Filter Results

| Filter Stage | Events Filtered | Events Remaining |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| Input (after merge) | - | 1001 |
| Distrito filter | 750 | 251 |
| GPS radius filter | 0 | 251 |
| No location match | 93 | 158 |
| Time filter (past events) | 21 | **137** |

### Critical Check: Plaza de Espa√±a Events

**Question**: Are we filtering out events AT Plaza de Espa√±a due to distrito being wrong?

**Answer**: ‚úÖ **NO** - Zero events within 0.35km of Plaza de Espa√±a were filtered by distrito

**Method**: Cross-checked all 750 distrito-filtered events against GPS coordinates to find any within 0.35km radius of Plaza de Espa√±a (40.42338, -3.71217).

**Result**: None found. All distrito-filtered events are genuinely outside our target area.

## Findings

### 1. Distrito Filter is Working Correctly ‚úÖ

**750 events filtered (75% of total)**

- All have distrito field populated
- Distrito is not CENTRO or MONCLOA-ARAVACA
- **CRITICAL**: None of these are within 0.35km of Plaza de Espa√±a
- Sample distritos: VICALVARO, PUENTE DE VALLECAS, SAN BLAS-CANILLEJAS, FUENCARRAL-EL PARDO, LATINA, RETIRO, MORATALAZ, CHAMARTIN

**Conclusion**: Distrito filter is accurate. We're not losing nearby events.

### 2. GPS Filter Has Zero Rejections ‚úÖ

**0 events filtered by GPS radius**

- All events without distrito field fall into two categories:
  1. Have coordinates within 0.35km ‚Üí kept
  2. Have no coordinates ‚Üí evaluated by text matching

**Conclusion**: GPS filter is working, but rarely triggered since most events have distrito.

### 3. Text Matching Filter Catches Edge Cases

**93 events filtered for no location match**

- No distrito field
- No GPS coordinates
- Don't mention "plaza de espa√±a", "templo de debod", "parque del oeste", or "conde duque" in venue/address/description

Sample filtered events:
```
- Acento Latino @ (no venue) | (no address)
- Moscard√≥ (en la plaza Jos√© Luis Hoys de 10 a 12 horas) @ (no venue)
- Campamento urbano de Navidad en Puente de Vallecas @ (no venue)
- Carrera de la Ciencia 2025 @ (no venue)
- Itinerario Ornitol√≥gico Parque Forestal de Valdebebas-Felipe VI @ (no venue)
```

**Observation**: These events have incomplete data (missing venue, missing coords). Cannot determine if relevant.

**Conclusion**: Text matching is working as intended for events with missing structured data.

### 4. Time Filter: Potential for Improvement ‚ö†Ô∏è

**21 events filtered for being "past events"**

Current rule: Started more than 60 days ago (even if still ongoing)

Sample filtered events:
```
- [38 days ago] Los caf√©s literarios de Madrid. El Caf√© de Pombo @ Espacio Cultural Serrer√≠a Belga
- [39 days ago] Nuevos imaginarios @ Centro de Cultura Contempor√°nea Conde Duque
- [40 days ago] Ensayos gr√°ficos @ Centro de Cultura Contempor√°nea Conde Duque
- [136 days ago] Madrid Art D√©co, 1925 @ Salas de exposiciones Conde Duque
- [378 days ago] Historia de Lavapi√©s @ Centro Cultural Lavapi√©s
- [919 days ago] Madrid, Musa de las Letras @ Espacio Cultural Serrer√≠a Belga
```

**Issues**:
- Long-running exhibitions (e.g., "Madrid Art D√©co" started 136 days ago, might still be ongoing)
- Some events at relevant venues (Conde Duque, Lavapi√©s, Serrer√≠a Belga in CENTRO)
- Very old events (919 days!) suggest stale data or missing end dates

**Conclusion**: Time filter cutoff (60 days) may be too aggressive for exhibitions. However, without proper end dates in data, hard to distinguish ongoing vs finished events.

## Recommendations

### 1. Current Filters are Good ‚úÖ

**Recommendation**: **Keep current filtering approach**

- Distrito filter: Accurate, no false negatives
- GPS filter: Working correctly
- Text matching: Handles edge cases appropriately
- No events AT Plaza de Espa√±a are being lost

### 2. Time Filter: Consider Refinement (Optional)

**Two options**:

**Option A**: Use end dates if available
```go
// Instead of filtering by start date, filter by end date
if evt.EndTime.Before(now) {
    // Event has definitely ended
    pastEvents++
    continue
}
```

**Option B**: Increase cutoff for exhibitions
```go
// Different cutoffs for different event types
if isExhibition(evt) {
    cutoff = now.AddDate(0, -6, 0) // 6 months for exhibitions
} else {
    cutoff = now.AddDate(0, 0, -60) // 60 days for regular events
}
```

**Impact**: Would add ~5-10 more long-running exhibition events

**Decision needed**: Are long-running exhibitions relevant to users?

### 3. Tagging System: Not Critical

**Original concern**: Are we losing events at Plaza de Espa√±a?

**Finding**: No, we're not.

**Recommendation**: **Tagging system not needed for correctness**

However, if you want visibility/debugging capabilities for future filter changes, the tagging system would be useful for:
- Monitoring filter performance over time
- A/B testing different filter criteria
- Generating CSV exports for manual review

**Cost-benefit**: Medium effort (2-3 hours) for low immediate value (filters already working). Consider only if you plan to iterate on filter criteria frequently.

### 4. Data Quality Issues

**Issue**: 93 events with no venue, no coordinates, no distrito

These are essentially unfilterable with current approach. Options:
- Ignore them (current approach)
- Report as data quality issues to datos.madrid.es
- Attempt fuzzy matching on event titles/descriptions

**Recommendation**: Ignore for now, not worth the effort.

## Summary

‚úÖ **Filters are working correctly**
‚úÖ **No events AT Plaza de Espa√±a are being lost**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Time filter might be too aggressive for long exhibitions** (optional fix)
‚ùå **Tagging system not critical** (filters already accurate)
üîÑ **UPDATED**: Changed to inclusive filter for incomplete data

## Decision: Be Inclusive, Not Exclusive

### Change Made

**Problem**: 93 events filtered out simply because they had no structured location data (no distrito, no coords).

**Issue**: Some of these ARE relevant! Examples:
- "Actividades mensuales de los centros de mayores del distrito Centro" (CENTRO district!)
- "Jardines escondidos. De √ìpera hasta Atocha" (√ìpera is near Plaza de Espa√±a)
- Walking tours, neighborhood events, etc.

**Solution**: **Changed filter to be INCLUSIVE by default**

```go
// OLD: Filter out events with no location match
if !matchesLocation {
    continue  // EXCLUDED
}

// NEW: Keep events even if location data is incomplete
// Rationale: Incomplete data ‚â† irrelevant event
missingBoth++
// Keep event by NOT filtering it out
```

### Impact

- **Before**: 137 cultural events
- **After**: 219 cultural events
- **Gain**: +82 events (60% increase!)

### Rationale

1. **Incomplete data doesn't mean irrelevant** - Event might still be in our area
2. **Better to show too many than too few** - Users can decide relevance
3. **Data quality issues upstream** - Not our problem to solve by exclusion
4. **Some clearly relevant events were excluded** - Walking tours, CENTRO district activities

**Action**: **Implemented** - Be inclusive about incomplete location data.
